# San-Francisco-Airbnb-Analysis

My final project submission for UCLA Extension Intro to Data Science taken Spring 2020.

In this project, I used a data set pulled from Kaggle including Airbnb observation data from October, 2019. Using a specific set of predictors, I attempt to train a multiple regression algorithm that can predict price per night of a given Airbnb listing.

This repository includes my Report, R Code, and the data set I used, pulled from
